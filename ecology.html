            <p>Coral reefs form some of the world's most productive ecosystems, providing complex and varied marine habitats that support a wide
        range of other organisms.Fringing reefs just below low tide level have a mutually beneficial relationship with mangrove
        forests at high tide level and sea grass meadows in between: the reefs protect the mangroves and seagrass from strong currents and
        waves that would damage them or erode the sediments in which they are rooted, while the mangroves and sea grass protect the coral
        from large influxes of silt, fresh water and pollutants. This level of variety in the environment benefits many coral reef animals,
        which, for example, may feed in the sea grass and use the reefs for protection or breeding.</p> <p>Reefs are home to a variety
             of animals, including fish, seabirds, sponges, cnidarians (which includes some types of corals and 
        jellyfish), worms, crustaceans (including shrimp, cleaner shrimp, spiny lobsters and crabs), mollusks (including cephalopods)
        echinoderms (including starfish, sea urchins and sea cucumbers), sea squirts, sea turtles and sea snakes. Aside from humans, 
        mammals are rare on coral reefs, with visiting cetaceans such as dolphins the main exception. A few species feed directly on
        corals, while others graze on algae on the reef. Reef biomass is positively related to species diversity.</p>
        <p>The same hideouts in a reef may be regularly inhabited by different species at different times of day. Nighttime predators such
        as cardinalfish and squirrelfish hide during the day, while damselfish, surgeonfish, triggerfish, wrasses and parrotfish hideouts
        from eels and sharks.</p>
        <p>The great number and diversity of hiding places in coral reefs, i.e. refuges, are the most important factor causing the great 
        diversity and high biomass of the organisms in coral reefs.Over 4,000 species of fish inhabit coral reefs.</p></div>
        <h3><i>Algae:</i></h3>
        <p>Reefs are chronically at risk of algal encroachment. Overfishing and excess nutrient supply from onshore can enable algae to
        algae can then smother the coral by decreasing the oxygen supply available to the reef.Decreased oxygen levels can 
        slow down calcification rates, weakening the coral and leaving it more susceptible to disease and degradation. Algae 
        inhabit a large percentage of surveyed coral locations.[120] The algal population consists of turf algae, coralline algae
        and macro algae. Some sea urchins (such as Diadema antillarum) eat these algae and could thus decrease the risk of algal
        outcompete and kill the coral. Increased nutrient levels can be a result of sewage or chemical fertilizer runoff. Runoff can
        carry nitrogen and phosphorus which promote excess algae growth. Algae can sometimes out-compete the coral for space. The 
        encroachment.
        
        <h3><i>Sponges:</i></h3>
        <p>Sponges are essential for the functioning of the coral reef that system. Algae and corals in coral reefs produce organic 
        material. This is filtered through sponges which convert this organic material into small particles which in turn are 
        absorbed by algae and corals.</p>
        
        <h3><i>Fish:</i></h3>
        <p>Over 4,000 species of fish inhabit coral reefs.The reasons for this diversity remain unclear. Hypotheses include the "lottery",
        in which the first (lucky winner) recruit to a territory is typically able to defend it against latecomers, "competition", in
        which adults compete for territory, and less-competitive species must be able to survive in poorer habitat, and "predation",
        in which population size is a function of postsettlement piscivore mortality. Healthy reefs can produce up to 35 tons of
        fish per square kilometer each year, but damaged reefs produce much less.</p>
        
        <i><h3>Invertebrates:</h3></i>
        <p>Sea urchins, Dotidae and sea slugs eat seaweed. Some species of sea urchins, such as Diadema antillarum, can play a pivotal part 
        in preventing algae from overrunning reefs. Researchers are investigating the use of native collector urchins, Tripneustes 
        gratilla, for their potential as biocontrol agents to mitigate the spread of invasive algae species on coral reefs.Nudibranchia
        and sea anemones eat sponges.</p>
        
        <p>A number of invertebrates, collectively called "cryptofauna," inhabit the coral skeletal substrate itself, either boring into the
        skeletons (through the process of bioerosion) or living in pre-existing voids and crevices. Animals boring into the rock include
        sponges, bivalve mollusks, and sipunculans. Those settling on the reef include many other species, particularly crustaceans and 
        polychaete worms.</p>
        
        <i><h3>Seabirds:</h3></i>
        <p>Coral reef systems provide important habitats for seabird species, some endangered. For example, Midway Atoll in Hawaii supports 
        nearly three million seabirds, including two-thirds (1.5 million) of the global population of Laysan albatross, and one-third of
        the global population of black-footed albatross.Each seabird species has specific sites on the atoll where they nest. Altogether,
        17 species of seabirds live on Midway. The short-tailed albatross is the rarest, with fewer than 2,200 surviving after excessive
        feather hunting in the late 19th century.</p>
        
        
        <i><h3>Other:</h3></i>
        <p><b><u>Sea snakes</u></b> feed exclusively on fish and their eggs.Marine birds, such as herons, gannets, pelicans and boobies, feed on reef
        fish. Some land-based reptiles intermittently associate with reefs, such as monitor lizards, the marine crocodile and semiaquatic
        snakes, such as Laticauda colubrina.<b><u> Sea turtles</u></b>, particularly hawksbill sea turtles, feed on <u>sponges</u>.</p>
