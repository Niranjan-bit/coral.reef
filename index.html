<p>'A coral reef is an underwater ecosystem characterized by reef-building corals. Reefs are formed of
   colonies of coral polyps held together by calcium carbonate. Most coral reefs are built from stony corals,
   whose polyps cluster in groups'.</p>
<P>Coral reefs first appeared 485 million years ago,
at the dawn of the Early Ordovician, displacing the microbial and sponge reefs of the Cambrian.Coral belongs to the class <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthozoa"> Anthozoa</a> in the animal
phylum <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cnidaria">Cnidaria</a>, which includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_anemone"> sea anemones</a>
  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jellyfish"> jellyfish.</a>
  Unlike sea anemones, corals secrete hard carbonate exoskeletons that support and protect the coral. Most reefs
   grow best in warm, shallow, clear, sunny and agitated water.</p>
<p>Sometimes called rainforests of the sea,shallow coral reefs form some of Earth's most diverse ecosystems.
  They occupy less than 0.1% of the world's ocean area, about half the area of France, yet they provide a home for
   at least 25% of all marine species,including fish, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollusca"> mollusks</a>,
    worms, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustacean">crustaceans</a>,
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinoderm"> echinoderms</a>, sponges,
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunicate">tunicates</a> and other cnidarians.Coral reefs flourish in ocean waters that provide few nutrients. They are most
   commonly found at shallow depths in tropical waters, but deep water and cold water coral reefs exist on smaller scales
    in other areas.</p>
<p>Coral reefs deliver ecosystem services for tourism, fisheries and
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_management">shoreline</a>
    protection. The annual global economic value of coral reefs is estimated between US$30â€“375 billion and
     US$9.9 trillion.Coral reefs are fragile,partly because they are sensitive to water conditions.</p>
