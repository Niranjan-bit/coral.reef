            <p>Coral reefs are dying around the world. Damaging activities include coral mining, pollution (organic and non-organic), overfishing, 
                blast fishing, the digging of canals and access into islands and bays.. ... Climate change, such as warming
                eratures, causes coral bleaching, which if severe kills the coral.</p>  </div>

                <p> <div id=upp>Plant a coral:</div><p>
                <p> Join our efforts to plant and restore corals in the Caribbean, Mexico, and Micronesia.</p>
                <p> <div id=upp> Explore a virtual coral reef:</div><p>
                <p> A partnership between Minecraft and The Nature Conservancy invites gamers to build with coral in-game to help restore and 
                    regrow coral IRL.  When players placed coral blocks in-game, they could affect coral regrowth in the Caribbean. In just a 
                    few days, 10 million blocks were placed in-game, and Minecraft contributed $100,000 to support the Conservancy’s coral 
                    restoration work. Additionally, through 2020, Minecraft will contribute the net proceeds from the brand new Coral Crafters
                    Skin Pack, a selection of sea-worthy skins from Ocean Explorer to Sea Pickle Monster!.Raise awareness of the 
                    importance of corals: Bonefish Grill supports the Conservancy’s Plant a Million Corals Initiative and is helping The
                    Nature Conservancy raise awareness about the importance of coral reefs. You can also share this page with your 
                    friends using the hashtag #CoralOn to let them know that coral reefs are critically important.</p>
                <p> <div id=upp>Visit a reef and dive responsibly:</div></p>
                <p> There’s no better way to appreciate one of Earth’s most diverse ecosystems than seeing it up close. 
                    Plan your next vacation so that you can spend an afternoon snorkeling or diving with a responsible guide. 
                    Do not touch the reef or anchor your boat on the reef. Contact with the coral will damage the delicate coral 
                    animals, and anchoring on the reef can kill it. Ask your dive or snorkel operator what they do to support reef
                    conservation. Let them know this issue is important to their customers.</p>
                <p> <div id=upp>Choose a reef-friendly sunscreen:</div></p>
                <p> Several common sunscreen ingredients, including oxybenzone and octinoxate, have been shown to be toxic to corals. 
                    Sunscreens that use non-nano zinc oxide as their active ingredients do not contribute to coral bleaching.</p>      
                <p> <div id=upp>Make your lawncare green:</div></p> 
                    You may live thousands of miles from a coral reef, but the products you put on your lawn will eventually flow into the 
                    water system. Research green alternatives for fertilizer and pesticides that won’t harm coral reefs and marine life.</p> 
                <p> <div id=upp>Leave no trace:</div></p>
                <p> Don't leave unwanted fishing lines or nets in the water or on the beach. Any kind of litter pollutes the water and can
                     harm the reef and fish.</p>
                <p> <div id=upp>Contact your representatives:</div></p>
                <p> Demand they take action to protect coral reefs, stop sewage pollution of our oceans, expand marine protected areas and
                    take steps to reverse climate change.</p>
